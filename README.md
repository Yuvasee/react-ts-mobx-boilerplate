# react-ts-mobx-boilerplate
__Simple Webpack boilerplate for React + Typescript + MobX + SASS stack__

***

__Why React?__
This framework, with so frontendish JSX syntax, most clearly reflects structure and logic of programming UI.

__Why MobX?__
The simple and straightforward way to comlete React with versatile data storage extracted from UI components tree logic and easily accessible from any point of UI.

__Why Typescript?__
Strict typing leads to fewer errors, which is always good. At the same time, while using it, you still can decide how much attention to pay for typing.

__Why SASS?__
As for me, it's not so important which CSS extensions to use. Everyone is fine.

__Why Webpack?__
Most powerful, well documented and maintained bundler of all.
